This is a simple example app to show you how to get your own Sensordrone app up and running.

Please use the comments in the source code as a guide.

The library file needed has been included in the /libs directory, as well,
so you shouldn't need to download anything extra.

Note: The latest version of this library can always be found at https://github.com/Sensorcon/Sensordrone


An example of importing this project into eclipse will be added later.
